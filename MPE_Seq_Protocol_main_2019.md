## **Library Prep Protocol:**

### **Poly-A Selection:**

Use NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (E7490S) to enrich for mRNA from 5 ug of RNA

  - **Do 4 tubes of polyA selection on 5 ug of total RNA each** (20 ug total RNA total) per sample to obtain enough mRNA for the first-strand synthesis
  - Expected yield is ~100ng mRNA in 20 uL per tube (400 ng in 80 uL total)

1. Start with 1-5 uL of DNA-free total RNA, dilute total RNA with nuclease free water to a final volume of 50 uL.
2. Aliquot 20 uL of well resuspended NEB Magnetic Oligo Beads in another 0.2 mL PCR tube.

6. Remove the tube from the magnetic rack.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 one more time, 2 washes total.
8. Resuspend beads in 50 uL of 2X RNA Binding Buffer and add 50 uL of total RNA sample from step 1.
9. Place tubes on thermal cycler, incubate at 65 **Â°** C for 5 min and hold at 4 **Â°** C to denature RNA and facilitate binding to beads. Can remove tubes once temperature reaches 4 **Â°**
10. Resuspend beads. Pipette up and down slowly 6 times to mix.
11. Place tubes on bench and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes to allow RNA to bind beads.
12. Resuspend the beads. Pipette up and down slowly 6 times to mix thoroughly.
13. Incubate for 5 more minutes at room temperature to allow the RNA to bind to the beads.
14. Place the tubes on the magnetic rack at room temperature for 2 minutes or until the solution is clear to separate the poly-A RNA bound to the beads from the solution.
15. Remove and discard all of the supernatant. Take care not to disturb the beads.
16. Remove the tubes from the magnetic rack.
17. Wash the beads by adding 200 Î¼l of Wash Buffer to remove unbound RNA. Pipette the entire volume up and down 6 times to mix thoroughly.

24. Remove the tubes from the thermal cycler when the temperature reaches 25Â°C.
25. Add 50 Î¼l of 2X RNA Binding Buffer to each sample to allow the RNA to bind to the same beads. Gently pipette the entire volume up and down 6 times to mix thoroughly.
26. Incubate the tubes on the bench at room temperature for 5 minutes.
27. Resuspend the beads. Pipette up and down slowly 6 times to mix thoroughly.
28. Incubate the tubes on the bench at room temperature for 5 more minutes to allow the RNA to bind to the beads.
29. Place the tubes on the magnetic stand at room temperature for 2 minutes or until the solution is clear.
30. Remove and discard all of the supernatant from each tube. Take care not to disturb the beads.
31. Remove the tubes from the magnetic rack.
32. Wash the beads once with 200 Î¼l of Wash Buffer. Gently pipette the entire volume up and down 6 times to mix thoroughly.
33. Place the tubes on the magnetic rack at room temperature for 2 minutes or until the solution is clear.
34. Remove and discard all of the supernatant from each tube. Take care not to disturb the beads.

    - **Note: It is important to remove all of the supernatant to successfully use the RNA in downstream steps. Spin down the tube. Place the tube on the magnetic rack and with a 10 Âµl tip remove all of the wash buffer. (Caution: Do not disturb beads that contain the mRNA).**
35. Remove the tubes from the magnetic rack.
36. Elute the mRNA from the beads by adding 17 Âµl of the Tris Buffer, mix by pipetting 6 times and incubating the sample at 80Â°C for 2 minutes, then hold at 25Â°C to elute the polyA RNA from the beads. Immediately, place the tubes on the magnetic rack for 2 minutes or until the solution is clear.
37. Collect the purified mRNA by transferring the supernatant to a clean nuclease-free PCR Tube.
38. Place tube on ice.
39. Assess the Yield and the Size Distribution of the purified mRNA. Run 1 Âµl on the Bioanalyzer using a RNA Pico Chip. You may have to dilute your sample before loading.

### **Assess Yield and Size Distribution of Purified mRNA**

**Bioanalyzer on RNA Pico Chip**

**See Bioanalyzer protocol for reference**

It is recommended to heat denature all RNA samples and RNA ladder before use for 2 min and 70 **Â°** C (once) and keep them on ice.

- Do not touch the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument during analysis and never place it on vibrating surface.
- Always vortex the dye concentrate for 10 s before preparing the gel-dye mix and spin down afterwards.

#### Preparing ladder:

1. Spin the ladder down
2. Heat denature the ladder for 2 min at 70Â°
3. Immediately cool the vial on ice.
4. Add 90 Î¼L of RNase-free water and mix thoroughly.
5. Prepare aliquots in recommended 0.5 mL RNase-free vials with the required amount for typical daily use.
6. Store aliquots at -70Â°
7. Before use, thaw ladder aliquots and keep them on ice (avoid extensive warming upon thawing process).

#### Clean the electrodes:

1. Slowly fill one of the wells of the electrode cleaner with 350 Î¼l of fresh RNase-free water.
2. Open the lid and place the electrode cleaner in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument.
3. Close the lid and leave it closed for 5 minutes.
4. Open the lid and remove the electrode cleaner. Label the electrode cleaner and keep it for future use.
5. Wait another 30 seconds to allow the water on the electrodes to evaporate before closing the lid.

#### Preparing the Gel

1. Allow all reagents to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 minutes before use.
2. Place 550 Î¼l of RNA 6000 Pico gel matrix (red ) into the top receptacle of a spin filter.
3. Place the spin filter in a microcentrifuge and spin for 10 minutes at 1500 g Â± 20 % (for Eppendorf microcentrifuge, this corresponds to 4000 rpm)
4. Aliquot 65 Î¼l filtered gel into 0.5 ml RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes that are included in the kit. Store the aliquots at 4Â°C and use them within one month of preparation.

#### Preparing the Gel-Dye Mix

1. Allow all reagents to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 minutes before use. Protect the dye concentrate from light while bringing it to room temperature.
2. Vortex RNA 6000 Pico dye concentrate (blue ) for 10 seconds and spin down.
3. Add 1 Î¼l of RNA 6000 Pico dye concentrate (blue ) to a 65 Î¼l aliquot of filtered gel (prepared as described in &quot;Preparing theGel&quot; n page 15).
4. Cap the tube, vortex thoroughly and visually inspect proper mixing of gel and dye. Store the dye concentrate at 4Â°C in the dark again.
5. Spin tube for 10 minutes at room temperature at 13000 g (for Eppendorf microcentrifuge, this corresponds to 14000 rpm). Use prepared gel-dye mix within one day.

#### Loading Gel-Dye Mix

1. 1 Allow the gel-dye mix to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 minutes before use. Protect the gel-dye mix from light during this time.
2. Take a new RNA chip out of its sealed bag.
3. Place the chip on the chip priming station.
4. Pipette 9.0 Î¼l of the gel-dye mix at the bottom of the well marked and dispense the gel-dye mix.
5. Set the timer to 30 seconds, make sure that the plunger is positioned at 1 ml and then close the chip priming station. The lock of the latch will click when the chip priming station is closed correctly.
6. Press the plunger of the syringe down until it is held by the clip.
7. Wait for exactly 30 seconds and then release the plunger with the clip release mechanism.
8. Visually inspect that the plunger moves back at least to the 0.3 ml mark.
9. Wait for 5 seconds, then slowly pull back the plunger to the 1 ml position.
10. Before loading the gel-dye mix, make sure that the base plate of the chip priming station is in position (C) and the adjustable clip is set to the highest position. Refer to &quot;Setting up the Chip Priming Station&quot; n page 8 for details.
11. When pipetting the gel-dye mix, make sure not to draw up particles that may sit at the bottom of the gel-dye mix vial. Insert the tip of the pipette to the bottom of the chip well when dispensing. This prevents a large air bubble forming under the gel-dye mix.

2. Directly add 20uL dNTP mix to the template/primer mix, ensuring that both samples are kept at **55Â°C**

   - **Note:** Maintaining a temperature of 50-55Â°C is crucial for minimizing non-specific primer annealing and thus off-target 1st stand products.
3. Allow the 1st strand synthesis reaction to proceed for 10 min at 55Â°C
4. Incubate sample at **80Â°C** for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme
   - **Note:** Sample volume is now 40uL

**This is a good stopping point for Day 1- put samples at -20C (or you can go through the RNA hydrolysis step as well and then freeze at -20C).**

### **Day 2:**

### **RNA Hydrolysis:**

Perform RNA hydrolysis to digest template RNA, leaving only the 1st strand cDNA products

      1. Add 20 uL of RNA hydrolysis solution to each sample
      2. Incubate at **65Â°C** for **15 min**

1. To each sample add:

   1. Add 2uL of sodium bicarbonate to each sample
   2. Add 2uL of NHS-biotin to each sample
2. Incubate sample at **65Â°C** for **1 hour** in the dark
   - **Note:** Perform the next few steps quickly to prevent biotin precipitation
3. Briefly spin tubes in a table top centrifuge, then place them back at **65Â°C** for 30 sec
4. Add 40uL pre-warmed ddH20 (warm to **65Â°C** first)
   - **Note:** Sample volume is now 60uL
5. Perform column cleanup  (use 420ul column binding buffer)
6. Elute in 50uL DEPC H20
7. Perform **streptavidin bead purification** n each sample
8. Perform **column purification** and elute in 40uL DEPC H20
9. You now have purified 1st strand cDNA
10. The protocol can be paused here by storing the samples at -20Â°C

### 1st Strand Extension
1. Prepare the following reaction mix for each sample:

| Reagent                     | Volume (uL) |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| 10X NEB Buffer 2            | 5           |

| 1st Strand Extension Primer | 1           |
| Total                       | 47          |

2. Incubate each sample at **65Â°C** for **2 min**.
3. Cool samples to RT by placing on bench top for **~5min**.
4. Add 3 uL of Klenow exo- enzyme to each sample.
5. Incubate samples at **25Â°C** (room temperature) **for** 5 min
6. Heat samples to **37Â°C** and incubate for **30 min**  (can stop here and place samples at -20C)
7. Perform **streptavidin bead purification** n each sample
8. Perform **column purification** n each sample eluting with 33uL of DEPC H20
9. You now have a library ready for PCR amplification

| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 98Â°C        30 s                                             |
| **Amplification (40x):**                                     |
| 98 Â°C        10 sec<br />62 Â°C        20 sec<br />72 Â°C        30 sec |

| 72 Â°C        3 min<br />4 Â°C        Hold                     |

**Using KAPA**

| **Denaturation:**                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 98Â°C        45 s                                             |

| 72 Â°C        1 min<br />4 Â°C        Hold                     |



4. After the qPCR calculate the Ct value for each sample and average the 3 values for each library
5. Calculate the number of amplification cycles to perform by adding 3 to the average Ct value and rounding to the nearest whole number.

- **Note:** This cycle number will vary from sample to sample by a few cycles. A good _S. cerevisiae_ library should have a Ct of ~12-16 cycles (15-19 cycles after addition of 3).  Experiments in our lab have determined that if a library has a Ct of greater than 18, the libraries are likely low quality.  Generally, this means a high proportion of 1st strand and 1st strand extension primer dimer reads will be present in the sequencing data.
