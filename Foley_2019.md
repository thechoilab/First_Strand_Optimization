1. Place the RNase inhibitor and SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase on ice and thaw the frozen TS-RT reagents to room temperature in your pre-PCR workstation.

2. Start Program 1: Frag + TS-RT in a designated amplification-free thermal cycler to pre-warm it.

	### Program 1: Frag + TS-RT	- 80 °C hold (add tube containing RNA and Fragmentation Mix)	- 80 °C 5 min	- 42 °C hold (add TS-RT Mix to tube)	- 42 °C 30 min	- 70 °C 10 min	- 4 °C hold

3. To 1 μL total RNA sample in a low-retention PCR tube or microplate well, add 4.0 μL Fragmentation Mix and mix by pipetting:

	- 2.0 μL SMARTScribe first-strand reaction buffer, 5X
	- 1.0 μL nuclease-free dNTP mix, 10 mM each
	- 0.5 μL 1S primer, 20 μM
	- 0.5 μL MgCl2, 80 mM

4. When Program 1 has reached the 80 C hold, place the tube in the thermal cycler and end the hold.

5. When the thermal cycler reaches the 42 C hold, remove and briefly centrifuge the tube, then add 5.0 μL TS-RT Mix and mix by pipetting:

	- 2.0 μL TMG, 5 M
	- 1.0 μL DTT, 20 mM
	- 0.5 μL RNase inhibitor, 20X
	- 0.5 μL 2S primer, 20 μM
	- 1.0 μL SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase, 100 U/μL

6. Immediately return the tube to the thermal cycler and end the 42 C hold.

Final PCR

1. Thaw the frozen PCR reagents to room temperature.

2. Just before needed, start Program 2: PCR in a thermal cycler designated for PCR, using the appropriate number of cycles for your library (see “Choosing the number of PCR cycles”).

3. Once Program 1 reaches the 4 ÅãC hold, remove and briefly centrifuge the tube, then, still in your pre-PCR workstation, add 2.5 μL PCR primer mix with this library's unique combination of indexes, 2 μM each.

4. Add 12.5 μL HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, 2X, and mix by pipetting.

5. When Program 2 has reached the 98 °C hold, place the tube in the thermal cycler and end the hold.

6. Continue with the cleanup protocol for either Option 1 or Option 2.

Option 1: Individual libraries, final PCR

1. When Program 2 reaches the 4 C hold and the sample has cooled, briefly centrifuge the tube, add 55 μL diluted SPRI bead mix and mix very well:

	- 25 μL molecular biology–grade water
	- 30 μL SPRI bead mix

2. Incubate the tube 1 min at room temperature.

3. Place the tube on the magnet and wait for the beads to separate completely (~ 2 min on V&P 771LD).

4. Without disturbing the pellet, remove and discard all the supernatant. Note: low-retention pipet tips are not necessary for steps 4–6.

5. Still on the magnet, add 200 μL freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the tube and wait 30 s.

6. Remove and discard the supernatant. Use a smaller pipet to collect residual droplets.

7. Leave the tube open to air-dry 1 min. Do not overdry the pellet or it will be difficult to resuspend.

8. Remove the tube from the magnet, thoroughly resuspend the pellet in 10 μL DNA Storage Buffer and wait 30 s.

9. Return the tube to the magnet and allow the beads to separate completely.

10. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube. This is your sequencing-ready library.
